# tqqq-sqqq-strategy
Python project for backtesting and live-trading TQQQ & SQQQ ETF strategies using **Interactive Brokers (IBKR)** API.  
Supports technical indicator optimization (MACD + RSI), parallel backtesting, and cloud deployment on AWS.

# TQQQ & SQQQ ETF Strategy Backtesting and IBKR Trading 

This project is a Python-based trading system designed for:
- Backtesting leveraged Nasdaq ETF strategies (TQQQ & SQQQ)
- Optimizing MACD + RSI logic with grid search and sliding windows
- Executing **automated live and paper trades via IBKR API (`ib_insync`)**
- Running large-scale backtests in parallel on **AWS EC2 + EBS + S3**
- Visualizing buy/sell signals and performance vs. Buy&Hold

---

## Features

- **Strategy**: MACD crossover with RSI filter
- **Optimization**: Grid search for ideal indicator thresholds
- **Rolling Windows**: Find 3-month high-growth strategies
- **Plotting**: Buy/sell signal chart + strategy vs. Buy&Hold performance
- **IBKR API Integration**: Full support for paper and real trading accounts
- **Parallel Backtesting**: Using `multiprocessing` to accelerate testing
- **Cloud Ready**: Deployed on AWS with EC2, EBS volumes, and S3 syncing
- **Modular Design**: Easily extend to new tickers, strategies, or brokers
